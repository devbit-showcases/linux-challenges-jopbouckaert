## Introduction to Linux challenges

### List of System Calls

The list all system calls is available on this link:
<http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syscalls.2.html>


### Standard C function wrappers

* open a file:
```c
FILE *fopen(const char *filename, const char *mode)
```

* write text to a file:
```c
int fputc( int c, FILE *fp );
```

* close the file:
```c
int fclose( FILE *fp );
```

* open an i2c device:
```c
```

* write to an i2c device
```c
```

* close the i2c device
```c
```

* create a child process / copy of current proces:
```c
```

* create a file
```c
```

#### What do you notice about the functions interact with a file and those to interact with an i2c device?

### Groups
#### Why would a system such as Linux need groups of users for?
>Linux uses groups as a way to organize users. Groups organize collections of accounts, primarily as a security measure. Control of group membership is administered through the `/   etc/group` file, which shows a list of groups and its members. Every user has a default or primary group. When a user logs in, the group membership is set for their primary group. This means that when a user launches a program or creates a file, both the file and the running program will be associated with the userâ€™s current group membership. A user may access other files in other groups, as long as they are also a member of that group and the access permissions are set.
